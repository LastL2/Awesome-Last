- [Cosmwasm Zero to Hero](https://github.com/Callum-A/cosmwasm-zero-to-hero) Learn CosmWasm so you can build Cosmos contracts
- [Cosmwasm Lectures](https://www.inflearn.com/course/dsrv-dev-playground) in Korean
- **[Area-52](https://area-52.io/) Master CosmWasm and smart contracts in Rust. Learn how to build your own multichain applications! Similar to Cryptozombies, fun and interactive coding lessons**
- [Cosmology](https://cosmology.zone/) developer tools to help you build in the Cosmos ecosystem
- [Cosmos Tutorials](https://cosmology.zone/learn) to learn how to build Cosmos app
- [Osmosis Educational Library](https://support.osmosis.zone/library) great source of cosmos education materials
Deep dive into Cosmos ecosystem: 
- [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/) is the first of thousands of interconnected blockchains that will eventually comprise the Cosmos Network. The primary token of the Cosmos Hub is the ATOM, but the Hub will support many tokens in the future.
- Build applications on CosmosSDK via [Ignite CLI](https://github.com/ignite/cli) platform to build, launch, and maintain any crypto application on a sovereign and secured blockchain. It is a developer-friendly interface to the Cosmos SDK, this CLI generates boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing business logic.

## Cosmos SDK
CosmosSDK acts as the state machine for LUC.
CosmosSDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Go programming language. Cosmos SDK is used to build [Gaia](https://hub.cosmos.network/getting-started/what-is-gaia), the application implementation build for the Cosmos Hub.

- [CosmosSDK Modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/building-modules/intro) can be seen as little state-machines within the state-machine. They generally define a subset of the state using one or more KVStores in the main multistore and a subset of message types. These messages are routed by one of the main components of Cosmos SDK core, BaseApp, to a module Protobuf Msg service that defines them.

### CometBFT
The CometBFT module is part of the Cosmos SDK stack. CometBFT is the a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. It is a fork of [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) and implements the Tendermint consensus algorithm.

BTF stands for Byzantine-Fault Tolerant 
CometBFT is [ABCI = Application Blockchain Interface](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/2-cosmos-concepts/1-architecture.html) package for networking and consensus layers of blockchain.
- Introduction to CometBFT [CometBFT: The consensus engine that fuels the cosmos ecosystem](https://medium.com/@ali-the-curious/cometbft-the-consensus-engine-that-fuels-the-cosmos-ecosystem-ff778fcba809) blog post by Allisgar Merchant
- CometBFT is essential component of Cosmos blockchain app architecture. CometBFT is a blockchain application platform supporting state machines in any language. The language-agnostic CometBFT helps developers securely and consistently replicate deterministic, finite-state machines.

# veGovernance
ve style governance design is based on Gauges and Bribes. The ve(3,3) governance design is composed of 3 parts:
- Gauge system
- Bribe for votes 
- Emissions that are paid out to wallets that stake assets in the gauge

The idea behind ve(3,3) governance model is that you (as user and developer) can influence the will of the voters with an incentive to direct emissions to the party providing something that you want. For example, [Curve](https://curve.fi/) uses ve style governance to bribe liquidity in specific pools.
