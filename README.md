### DeFi Tools
- [DeFi Adapter Library ](https://github.com/consensys-vertical-apps/mmi-defi-adapters/tree/main) designed to simplify and standardize the process of fetching and interacting with data from various DeFi protocols, which often have unique interfaces and data structures. By MetaMask

# Last Custody Network
Consensus Network


### Last Custody Network (LCN) is leveraging Cosmos SDK
CosmosSDK is a framework for building applications in Golang 
- [Understand SDK Modules](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/tutorials/8-understand-sdk-modules/)
- [Learn to build via Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/)
- [Overview of the Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/intro/overview)
- Last is [application specific blockchain](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/intro/why-app-specific)

## CometBFT
CometBFT andles consensus and networking in the LCN. CometBFT is the a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. It is a fork of [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) and implements the Tendermint consensus algorithm.
BTF stands for Byzantine-Fault Tolerant

Editing this part: 
### Last Custody Network (LCN) is leveraging the Bifroest module for its twinchain communication module:
- [Bifroest signer](https://docs.thorchain.org/how-it-works/technology#signer-bifroest)

### Last Custody Network (LCN) is leveraging TSS for key management: 
- [Threshold Signature Schemes](https://medium.com/nethermind-eth/threshold-signature-schemes-36f40bc42aca)

### Last L2 is utilizing Arbitrum Nitro: 
- [Arbitrum Nitro: one small step for L2, one giant leap for Ethereum](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-nitro-one-small-step-for-l2-one-giant-leap-for-ethereum-bc9108047450) blog post
- [Arbitrum Nitro Introduction](https://docs.arbitrum.io/why-nitro) docs page 
- [Shorter introduction of Arbitrum Nitro](https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/public-chains#nitro) docs page

Last is utilizing the Stylus framework by Arbitrum, which is a bit more efficient compared to other frameworks. Learn more about Stylus:

# Node provides
Run node for Last ‚¨õÔ∏è 

Guidelines:
- [Spin up your own Ethereum node](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/) by @nhsz
- [How to deploy a ThorChain node on Linux](https://www.blockmeadow.com/how-to-deploy-a-thorchain-node-on-linux/) by BlockMeadow
- [Run Thorchain node](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/blob/develop/README.md#setup) by Official Thorchain node repo. Tutorial is Linux and Mac OS compatible
- [Run Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#setup-a-full-node) by Bitcoin.org

### Recommendation from our community to run Ethereum node: 
- Input from Brian, Co-founder @ Ansybl.io
here are a few things to keep in mind: 
1. SSD choice is the most important from a hardware perspective. An NVMe drive is preferred. 2TB minimum but the more the better (especially now that we‚Äôve got blobs live on mainnet). If you're running in a cloud environment, most drives are network-attached and will most likely be your bottleneck when it comes to sync times/rpc response time.
2. Reth is fast becoming my favorite execution client. Fast, configurable and takes less disk space
3. Take advantage of performance monitoring endpoints that come with nodes. It‚Äôs easy to spin up a Grafana dashboard for most clients, and it‚Äôll make your life so much easier when debugging any issues
- [Nimbus node guide](https://nimbus.guide/index.html)
  
### Recommendation from our community to run ThorChain node:
- Input from Andro, Co-founder @ Last: 
you need good bandwidth, and a fair amount of HDD space,  with a decent processor. The node requirements aren't like your typical cosmos chains where they are fairly light(minus bandwidth)

# Governance
Last is using the Gauge and Bribe system for its governance. You can learn more about Gauge and Bribes here:

Last is utilising ve(3,3) system which is composed of 3 parts = 
- Gauge system
- Bribe for votes 
- and some emissions paid out to the stakers of the gauges

Last will sorta use 3,3 mechanism. Here is outline of 3,3 voting mechanism. We will create a page in docs on this. Here is just a brief introduction: 

The idea behind ve(3,3) governance model is that you (as user & developer) can influence the will of the voters with a direct incentive, to direct the value(emissions) to the party providing something of want. In case of Curve, it means liquidity. In case of Last, it means deposited assets into the chain = yield-bearing assets.

Different protocols have its own explanations of these terms:
- [Gauges overview](https://docs.curve.fi/curve_dao/liquidity-gauge-and-minting-crv/gauges/overview/) by Curve docs
- [Gauges for EVM sidechains](https://docs.curve.fi/curve_dao/liquidity-gauge-and-minting-crv/evm-sidechains/overview/) by Curve docs
- [ve(3,3)](https://andrecronje.medium.com/ve-3-3-44466eaa088b) blog post by Andre Cronje
- [Voting and Gauge Weights](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/why-convex/voting-and-gauge-weights) Convex Finance docs
- [Gauge](https://docs.frax.finance/vefxs/gauge) Frax Finance docs explaining in more depths how Gauge works
- [Options Liquidity Mining](https://docs.poolshark.fi/token/why-ofin) Poolshark docs, Last is utilizing OLM mechanism design for its governance
- [Deploying a gauge](https://docs.bunni.pro/docs/guides/deploy-gauge) Bunni docs, this is an example of how to deploy gauge by Bunni. Bunni is using very similar governance model to Curve.
