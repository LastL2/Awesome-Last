# Last Custody Network
LCN acts as the accounting vault of the LAST protocol. LCN utilizes Cosmos, Ethereum and Bitcoin as multichain yield-bearing protocol. Initial protocol design is utilising EigenPod contracts that Node operators utilize. Consensus-based Network acts as accounting vault for Last L2.
# LCN Infrastructure

## Cosmos SDK
LCN is using CosmosSDK as state machine for LCN 
CosmosSDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Go programming language. Cosmos SDK is used to build [Gaia](https://hub.cosmos.network/getting-started/what-is-gaia), the application implementation build for the Cosmos Hub.

"Cosmos SDK modules can be seen as little state-machines within the state-machine. They generally define a subset of the state using one or more KVStores in the main multistore, as well as a subset of message types. These messages are routed by one of the main components of Cosmos SDK core, BaseApp, to a module Protobuf Msg service that defines them." - [CosmosSDK Modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/building-modules/intro)
- [Understand SDK Modules](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/tutorials/8-understand-sdk-modules/)
- [Learn to build via Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/learn/intro/overview)
- Last is [application-specific blockchain, here is introduction to app specific blockchains](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/learn/intro/why-app-specific)

- [Building Scalable Applications with the Cosmos SDK](https://medium.com/@jefferyokesamuel1/building-scalable-applications-with-the-cosmos-sdk-6dc56ae28643) introduction alike post about Cosmos SDK

## CometBFT
CometBFT handles consensus and networking in the LCN. CometBFT is the a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. It is a fork of [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) and implements the Tendermint consensus algorithm.

CometBFT is the most (and only) mature BFT consensus engine in existence. It is widely used across the industry and is considered the gold standard consensus engine for building Proof-of-Stake systems.

BTF stands for Byzantine-Fault Tolerant 
CometBFT is [ABCI = Application Blockchain Interface](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/2-cosmos-concepts/1-architecture.html) package for networking and consensus layers of blockchain
- Introduction to CometBFT [CometBFT: The consensus engine that fuels the cosmos ecosystem](https://medium.com/@ali-the-curious/cometbft-the-consensus-engine-that-fuels-the-cosmos-ecosystem-ff778fcba809) blog post by Allisgar Merchant
- CometBFT is essential component of Cosmos blockchain app architecture. It is CometBFT is a blockchain application platform which supports state machines in any language. The language-agnostic CometBFT helps developers securely and consistently replicate deterministic, finite-state machines.
- [Explore CometBFT into the details](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/) via documentation intoruction
- [Blockchain architecture explaining state machine, CometBFT, ABCI](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/learn/intro/sdk-app-architecture)

### Interested in diving deeper into the Cosmos ecosystem explore: 
- [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/) is the first of thousands of interconnected blockchains that will eventually comprise the Cosmos Network. The primary token of the Cosmos Hub is the ATOM, but the Hub will support many tokens in the future.
- Build applications on CosmosSDK via [Ignite CLI](https://github.com/ignite/cli) platform to build, launch, and maintain any crypto application on a sovereign and secured blockchain. It is a developer-friendly interface to the Cosmos SDK, this CLI generates boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing business logic.

### Last Custody Network (LCN) is leveraging the Bifroest module for its twin chain communication module:
- [Bifroest signer](https://docs.thorchain.org/how-it-works/technology#signer-bifroest)

### Last Custody Network (LCN) is leveraging TSS for key management: 
- [Threshold Signature Schemes](https://medium.com/nethermind-eth/threshold-signature-schemes-36f40bc42aca)

## Staked assets on LCN
- [EigenLayer: How Restaking Will Transform Security for Ethereum-Based Protocols](https://medium.com/@mustafa.hourani/eigenlayer-how-restaking-will-transform-security-for-ethereum-based-protocols-fd37c01be44e)
- [EigenPods](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/native-restaking/create-eigenpod-and-set-withdrawal-credentials/)


## LCN Node Operators
The Last Custody Network is leveraging the THORNode service of the THORChain network, which communicates and operates in cooperation to create a cross-chain swapping network. We will be utilising THORChain minimally in the LAST Protocol design. 
- [THORNode overview](https://docs.thorchain.org/thornodes/overview) docs page
- [Churn mechanism of validators](https://docs.thorchain.org/thornodes/overview) LCN will have 1 week epoch for validator


## Node provides
Run node for Last ‚¨õÔ∏è 
Guidelines:
- [Spin up your own Ethereum node](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/) by @nhsz
- [How to deploy a ThorChain node on Linux](https://www.blockmeadow.com/how-to-deploy-a-thorchain-node-on-linux/) by BlockMeadow
- [Run Thorchain node](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/blob/develop/README.md#setup) by Official Thorchain node repo. Tutorial is Linux and Mac OS compatible
- [Run Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#setup-a-full-node) by Bitcoin.org

### Recommendation from our community to run the Ethereum node: 
- Input from Brian, Co-founder @ Ansybl.io
here are a few things to keep in mind: 
1. SSD choice is the most important from a hardware perspective. An NVMe drive is preferred. 2TB minimum, but the more, the better (especially now that we‚Äôve got blobs live on the mainnet). If you're running in a cloud environment, most drives are network-attached and will most likely be your bottleneck when it comes to sync times/rpc response time.
2. Reth is fast becoming my favorite execution client. Fast, configurable, and takes less disk space
3. Take advantage of performance monitoring endpoints that come with nodes. It‚Äôs easy to spin up a Grafana dashboard for most clients, and it‚Äôll make your life so much easier when debugging any issues
- [Nimbus node guide](https://nimbus.guide/index.html)
  
### Recommendation from our community to run THORNode:
We will utilize THORNode protocol designs for our LCN infrastructure
- Input from Andro, Co-founder @ Last: 
you need good bandwidth, and a fair amount of HDD space,  with a decent processor. The node requirements aren't like your typical cosmos chains where they are fairly light(minus bandwidth)

# Last L2 
Is utilizing Arbitrum Nitro stack
- [Arbitrum Nitro: one small step for L2, one giant leap for Ethereum](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-nitro-one-small-step-for-l2-one-giant-leap-for-ethereum-bc9108047450) blog post

- [Shorter introduction of Arbitrum Nitro](https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/public-chains#nitro) docs page

## Stylus framework 
Last is utilizing the Stylus framework by Arbitrum, which is a bit more efficient than other frameworks. They call Stylus EVM+ as everything is entirely additive and is not replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Stylus allows smart contracts to be written in languages like Rust, C, and C++, which can be more efficient than Solidity, which can lead to faster and cheaper smart contracts.

# veGovernance
Last is using ve style Governance system based on Gauges and Bribes for its governance. 

Last is utilising ve(3,3) system which is composed of 3 parts = 
- Gauge system
- Bribe for votes 
- and some emissions paid out to the stakes of the gauges

Last will sorta use 3,3 mechanism. Here is outline of 3,3 voting mechanism. We will create a page in docs on this. Here is just a brief introduction: 

The idea behind ve(3,3) governance model is that you (as user & developer) can influence the will of the voters with a direct incentive, to direct the value(emissions) to the party providing something of want. In case of Curve, it means liquidity. In case of Last, it means deposited assets into the chain = yield-bearing assets.
