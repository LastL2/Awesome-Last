# Utility Chain
The Last Custody Network (LCN) the Utility Chain of Twinchain protocol design of LAST Network. Utility chain acts as accounting layer for LAST L2. The primary function is to handle operations such as bridge and yield-bearing accounting.
LCN utilizes Cosmos, Ethereum, and Bitcoin as multichain yield-bearing protocols. The utility chain is used only by Node Operators

## Cosmos SDK
CosmosSDK acts as the state machine for LCN 
CosmosSDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Go programming language. Cosmos SDK is used to build [Gaia](https://hub.cosmos.network/getting-started/what-is-gaia), the application implementation build for the Cosmos Hub.

- [CosmosSDK Modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/building-modules/intro) can be seen as little state-machines within the state-machine. They generally define a subset of the state using one or more KVStores in the main multistore and a subset of message types. These messages are routed by one of the main components of Cosmos SDK core, BaseApp, to a module Protobuf Msg service that defines them.

### CometBFT
CometBFT module will be a part of the Cosmos SDK stack. CometBFT handles consensus and networking in the LCN. CometBFT is the a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. It is a fork of [Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) and implements the Tendermint consensus algorithm.

CometBFT is the most (and only) mature BFT consensus engine in existence. It is widely used across the industry and is considered the gold standard consensus engine for building Proof-of-Stake systems.

BTF stands for Byzantine-Fault Tolerant 
CometBFT is [ABCI = Application Blockchain Interface](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/2-cosmos-concepts/1-architecture.html) package for networking and consensus layers of blockchain

- CometBFT is essential component of Cosmos blockchain app architecture. CometBFT is a blockchain application platform supporting state machines in any language. The language-agnostic CometBFT helps developers securely and consistently replicate deterministic, finite-state machines.

 # Utility Chain Node Operators
Every Utility Chain Node Operator is required to run Ethereum and Bitcoin full nodes. 
The Last Utility Chain leverages some of the THORChain and THORNode architecture designs.

### Threshold Signature Schemes, Chrun module, Node bonding design, Bifroest module
TSS will be used on Last Utility chain and is apart of the Validator voting design structure. Utility chain is leveraging the Bifroest module for its twin-chain communication module and cross-chain swaps

## Run Node for LAST
Run node for LAST ⬛️  It requires you to run Ethereum Full node, Bitcoin Full node and Cosmos full node
Guidelines:
- [Spin up your own Ethereum node](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/) blog post
- [Run Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#setup-a-full-node) docs page

### Recommendation from our community to run the Ethereum node: 
- Input from Brian, Co-founder @ Ansybl.io
here are a few things to keep in mind: 
1. SSD choice is the most important from a hardware perspective. An NVMe drive is preferred. 2TB minimum, but the more, the better (especially now that we’ve got blobs live on the mainnet). If you're running in a cloud environment, most drives are network-attached and will most likely be your bottleneck when it comes to sync times/rpc response time.
2. Reth is fast becoming my favorite execution client. Fast, configurable, and takes less disk space
3. Take advantage of performance monitoring endpoints that come with nodes. It’s easy to spin up a Grafana dashboard for most clients, and it’ll make your life so much easier when debugging any issues

## EVM+ Stylus framework 
Last is utilizing the Stylus framework by Arbitrum, which is a bit more efficient than other frameworks. They call Stylus EVM+ as everything is entirely additive and is not replacing the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Stylus allows smart contracts to be written in languages like Rust, C, and C++, which can be more efficient than Solidity, leading to faster and cheaper smart contracts.

# veGovernance
ve style Governance design is based on Gauges and Bribes. The ve(3,3) governance design is composed of 3 parts:
- Gauge system
- Bribe for votes 
- and some emissions that are paid out to the stakes of gauges

The idea behind ve(3,3) governance model is that you (as user and developer) can influence the will of the voters with an incentive to direct the value(emissions) to the party providing something that you want. For example, [Curve](https://curve.fi/) uses ve style Governance to bribe liquidity.
